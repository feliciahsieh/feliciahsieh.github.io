	<h2>Felicia Hsieh</h2>
	<p>Welcome to my <a href="http://feliciahsieh/feliciahsieh.github.io">website</a>, where you can find my <a href="https://feliciahsieh.github.io/cv/">Github resume</a> created with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. This was created in less than a day.</p>
	<p>After attending <a href="http://www.holbertonschool.com">Holberton School</a>, my <a href="http://www.github.com/feliciahsieh">Github</a> is filled with hundreds of software programs and scripts demonstrating my skills in C, Python, Javascript, AJAX, JQuery, bash, mySQL, HTML/CSS, and some (very) modest amount of Assembly and Ruby. We also covered other software frameworks as well, such as Flask, SQLAlchemy, Git, and now, Jekyll. All of my code was created in <u>9 months</u> (minus some code from hackathons).</p>
	<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Thanks.</p>
